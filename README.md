# ML-Explorer

ML-Explorer is a project for monitoring ML-Agents training sessions and their outputs. ML-Agents is a powerful framework for creating intelligent agents in games and simulations using reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and other methods. ML-Explorer allows you to explore various models and their respective running training jobs (headless server instances) and visualize their progress and performance.

## Features

- Track and compare multiple ML-Agents training sessions and their outputs
- Generate reports and summaries of your ML-Agents results
- Analyze and visualize your ML-Agents data and metrics
- Optimize and improve your ML-Agents policies and parameters
- Experiment with different ML-Agents settings and scenarios

## Installation

To use ML-Explorer, you need to have the following installed:

- [Microsoft Edge] browser
- [Unity Hub] and [Unity Editor] with ML-Agents package
- [Python] and [mlagents] package

To install ML-Explorer, you can clone this repository or download the zip file. Then, open the ML-Explorer folder in your preferred code editor.

## Usage

To use ML-Explorer, you need to follow these steps:

1. Launch the Microsoft Edge browser and open the ML-Explorer web page.
2. Launch the Unity Hub and open the ML-Agents project that you want to monitor.
3. Launch the Python terminal and run the mlagents-learn command with the appropriate configuration file and environment name.
4. On the ML-Explorer web page, enter the name of your training session and the port number that you are using for communication between Unity and Python.
5. Click on the "Start Monitoring" button and watch the graphs and charts update in real time as your ML-Agents train.
6. Repeat steps 2 to 5 for any other ML-Agents projects that you want to monitor simultaneously.
7. To stop monitoring, click on the "Stop Monitoring" button and close the Unity and Python terminals.
